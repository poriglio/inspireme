			<h1>Inspire Me!</h1>
			<p>Maybe I'm having a bad day. Maybe I could use a bit of a pick-me-up, and the array of positive self-talk in my head just isn't cutting it right now. Maybe I feel so rotten, I don't think anything you say will do jack shit for me, either. Take that as a challenge. Go ahead. Inspire me!</p>
